        Implement POST API creating User #8
            We need to implement a POST API endpoint to create a new user in our application. This endpoint should accept user details in the request body, hash the user's password.
            Endpoint: POST /users

        Swagger Documentation Integration for Gin Framework #23
            We need to integrate Swagger documentation into our Gin-based API to provide comprehensive and interactive API documentation. This will help developers understand the API endpoints, request/response structures, and expected behaviors without needing to dig into the codebase.

            Key Requirements:
                Swagger UI Integration: Set up Swagger UI to serve interactive API documentation.
                Annotations: Add Swagger annotations to the Gin routes to generate accurate API documentation.
                Automatic Documentation Generation: Ensure that the Swagger documentation is automatically generated and updated based on the codebase.
                Endpoint Details: Each endpoint should include details such as:
                HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
                Path parameters
                Query parameters
                Request body (if applicable)
                Response body and status codes
                Example requests and responses
                Error Responses: Document common error responses and their meanings.
                Security Definitions: Include details about authentication and authorization mechanisms if applicable.
            Expected Outcome:
                A fully functional Swagger UI accessible at a specific endpoint (e.g., /swagger/index.html).
                Comprehensive and up-to-date API documentation that reflects the current state of the API.
                Easy-to-understand examples and descriptions for each endpoint.
            Additional Notes:
                Consider using a library like swaggo/swag to simplify the integration process.
                Ensure that the Swagger documentation is only available in development and staging environments, and not in production, if necessary.

        Create Model for User #12
            Created a model with the following fields:
                Username

            Use environment variables for database credentials and connection details.
        
        Validate already existing User #10
            Implement validation to check if a user with the same username or email already exists before creating a new user. Also, to check at the login if the user exists or not.
            Endpoint: POST /users/read/:username

        Implement DELETE API for Deleting User #9
            We need to implement a DELETE API endpoint to delete an existing user from our application. This endpoint should accept the username as a URL parameter. Log the data that needs to be removed on the console screen.

            Acceptance Criteria:

                Endpoint: DELETE /users/:username
                URL Parameter: username(string, required)
        
        Implement POST API creating User #8
            We need to implement a POST API endpoint to create a new user in our application. This endpoint should accept user details in the request body, hash the user's password.
